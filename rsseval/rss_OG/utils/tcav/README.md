# TCAV

Conducting TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors) evaluation for neural models such as `CLIP` and neural networks (`NNs`).

## How to Use

To perform TCAV evaluation, you need to configure the arguments in `tcav/main.py`. You can customize the parameters according to your specific requirements.

Run the evaluation with the following command:

```sh
python tcav/main.py
```

**Note:** Be sure to specify the layer you wish to evaluate within `main.py`. Adjust the configuration to target the desired layer of your neural network for the evaluation.

## Evaluation Results

For detailed evaluation results, refer to the `tcav/notebook` directory. It contains notebooks designed to help you analyze and interpret the TCAV results comprehensively.
